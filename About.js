          In ancient manuscripts, another mean to divide sentences into
          paragraphs was a line break (newline) followed by an initial at the
          beginning of the next paragraph. An initial is an oversized capital
          letter, sometimes outdented beyond the margin of the text. This style
          can be seen, for example, in the original Old English manuscript of
          Beowulf. Outdenting is still used in English typography, though not
          commonly.[3] Modern English typography usually indicates a new
          paragraph by indenting the first line. This style can be seen in the
          (handwritten) United States Constitution from 1787. For additional
          ornamentation, a hedera leaf or other symbol can be added to the
          inter-paragraph white space, or put in the indentation space.
